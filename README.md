So what have we learned in the last two leesons?
- Packages- what is a package, package naming, what it contains? it contains: classes, interfaces, enumartions and annotations
- import pacakge content (access package content) in three ways: regular import of specific class/interfcae... , import all the of the package content using the * wildcard, specifing the fill name including the packge each time using the class/interface
- What to do when there is name collision between different packages?
- We have seen some of java predefined packages and explored their content

- Exceptions- what is exception, Exception base class, exceptions inheritance tree, predefined exceptions, checked exception (compile time) and unchecked exceptions (runtime),
  we have also seen that where are errors which are a little different than exceptions.
- Exception handling- two ways to handle exceptions- one is validating first, second is using try catch
- try catch finally blocks
- multi catch block
