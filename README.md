So what have we learned in the last two leesons?

- Exceptions- what is exception, Exception base class, exceptions inheritance tree, predefined exceptions, checked exception (compile time) and unchecked exceptions (runtime),
  we have also seen that where are errors which are a little different than exceptions.
- Exception handling- two ways to handle exceptions- one is validating first, second is using try catch
- try catch finally blocks
- multi catch block
